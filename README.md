# 🌍 Bridging Language Barriers
### Real-Time AI Translation for Video Conferencing

## 🚀 Introduction
In today’s connected world, **multilingual communication** is no longer optional—it's essential.  
This project aims to solve that by providing **real-time AI translation** for video conferencing platforms.  
Through seamless **interaction across languages**, it enables people to communicate naturally without worrying about linguistic differences.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Most video conferencing platforms **lack live, accurate multilingual translation**, which results in:  
- Miscommunication and misunderstandings  
- Reduced engagement in global discussions  
- Dependence on costly and unscalable human interpreters  

---

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
We aim to build an AI-powered solution that can:  
- 🎤 **Capture & transcribe speech in real time**  
- 🌐 **Translate between languages live**  
- 💬 **Display instant captions or provide speech output**  
- 🔗 **Integrate with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams**  
- ⚡ Achieve **< 3 seconds latency**, **high translation accuracy**, and **strong privacy controls**

## 🌐 Applications
- **Business** → Empower global teams to collaborate freely  
- **Education** → Support diverse, multilingual classrooms  
- **Government** → Facilitate inclusive, multilingual policy discussions  
- **Events & Webinars** → Expand reach to an international audience

## 📌 Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper / DeepSpeech / Vosk  
- **Translation**: MarianMT / M2M100 / GPT-powered translation  
- **Integration**: Zoom/Meet/Teams SDKs & APIs  
- **Frontend**: React.js (captions UI), WebSocket for real-time updates  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask) for streaming & translation pipeline

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🎧 Voice cloning for translated speech (preserving tone/emotion)  
- 📱 Mobile support for hybrid/remote meetings  
- 🤝 Multi-speaker separation with diarization  
- 🔒 On-device / encrypted processing for sensitive data
