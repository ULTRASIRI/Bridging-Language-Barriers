# 🗺️ Project Roadmap  
**Bridging Language Barriers: Real-Time AI Translation for Video Conferencing**

---

## 📌 Phase 1 – Foundation (Month 1–2)  
**Goal:** Build the core pipeline for speech recognition + translation.  
- [ ] Set up project repo & documentation structure  
- [ ] Research & select speech-to-text model (e.g., Whisper, Vosk, DeepSpeech)  
- [ ] Research & select translation model (e.g., MarianMT, M2M100, GPT-based)  
- [ ] Implement backend pipeline:  
  - Audio capture → Speech-to-Text → Translation → Output captions  
- [ ] Simple CLI/terminal-based demo for one-to-one translation  

---

## 📌 Phase 2 – Real-Time Captioning (Month 3–4)  
**Goal:** Deliver real-time, multi-language captions.  
- [ ] Build **frontend UI** (React/Next.js) for live captions  
- [ ] Implement **WebSocket streaming** for low-latency updates  
- [ ] Optimize pipeline for < 3s latency  
- [ ] Support **multiple output languages** per meeting  
- [ ] Add **basic privacy features** (local processing or anonymization)  

---

## 📌 Phase 3 – Platform Integration (Month 5–6)  
**Goal:** Make it usable inside real meetings.  
- [ ] Explore APIs/SDKs for Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams  
- [ ] Build integration layer for at least **one platform**  
- [ ] Implement **multi-speaker support** (diarization or speaker tagging)  
- [ ] Deploy MVP as a **desktop app or browser extension**  

---

## 📌 Phase 4 – Advanced Features (Month 7–9)  
**Goal:** Improve accuracy, usability, and accessibility.  
- [ ] Add **voice output in translated language** (TTS)  
- [ ] Add **voice cloning** (preserve speaker tone/emotion)  
- [ ] Add **mobile app support** (iOS/Android)  
- [ ] Provide **analytics dashboard** (accuracy, latency, usage)  
- [ ] Enable **offline mode** with on-device models  

---

## 📌 Phase 5 – Scaling & Community (Month 10–12)  
**Goal:** Make it production-ready & community-driven.  
- [ ] Optimize for **scalability** (Docker, Kubernetes, cloud hosting)  
- [ ] Add **end-to-end encryption** for sensitive conversations  
- [ ] Open-source release with clear **contribution guidelines**  
- [ ] Community testing & feedback loop  
- [ ] Launch v1.0 🚀  

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision  
- AI assistant that **summarizes multilingual meetings** in real time  
- **AR glasses integration** → live translated captions in the field of view  
- **Sign language support** with computer vision + avatar rendering  
- Industry-specific translation (business jargon, medical terminology, legal)
