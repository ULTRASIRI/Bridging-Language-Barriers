# Bridging Language Barriers

This is a single-file web illustration created using **Three.js** to visualize the concept of real-time AI-powered language translation. The animation shows communication traveling from one person to a central AI orb, which processes the information and sends the translated output to the other person.

The project is designed to be a simple, self-contained demonstration and does not require a web server to run.

## âœ… Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the page structure and basic styling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling.
- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D library for creating and animating the scene.
- **OrbitControls.js**: A Three.js helper that allows for interactive camera controls.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Since this is a single `.html` file, it's very easy to run and view the illustration.

1. **Save the file**:  
   Ensure you have the `translation_3d.html` file saved to your local computer.

2. **Open in a browser**:  
   Simply double-click the `translation_3d.html` file. It will open in your default web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

3. **Interact with the scene**:  
   Once the page loads, you can use your mouse to explore the animation.
   - **Click and Drag**: Orbit the camera around the central AI orb.
   - **Scroll**: Zoom in and out.
